Ingredients:

    5 ears corn, shucked (I used 2 15.25oz cans of corn)
    1⁄4 cup milk
    2 tablespoons sugar (I increased this to 4 tbsp)
    1⁄2 teaspoon coarse salt
    1⁄4 teaspoon fresh ground pepper
    1 large egg
    3⁄4 cup finely ground cornmeal
    4 tablespoons butter
Directions:

    In the bowl of a food processor fitted with the metal blade, puree the corn with milk, sugar, salt, pepper, egg and cornmeal. The batter should be the consistency of a thick pancake batter.
    Heat a large nonstick saute pan over low heat. Add 1 tbsp butter.
    When the butter has melted and is hot, add batter, forming 3 inch rounds. Cook for 2 minutes on each side.
    Repeat process with remaining butter and batter.
    The cachapas may be made 2 hours in advance and kept uncovered at room temperature. They may be reheated in a 350°F oven until heated through.
